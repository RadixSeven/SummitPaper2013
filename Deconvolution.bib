abstract = {Extracting meaningful information from complex spectroscopic data of metabolite mixtures is an area of active research in the emerging field of "metabolomics", which combines metabolism, spectroscopy, and multivariate statistical analysis (pattern recognition) methods. Chemometric analysis and comparison of 1H NMR1 spectra is commonly hampered by intersample peak position and line width variation due to matrix effects (pH, ionic strength, etc.). Here a novel method for mixture analysis is presented, defined as "targeted profiling". Individual NMR resonances of interest are mathematically modeled from pure compound spectra. This database is then interrogated to identify and quantify metabolites in complex spectra of mixtures, such as biofluids. The technique is validated against a traditional "spectral binning" analysis on the basis of sensitivity to water suppression (presaturation, NOESY-presaturation, WET, and CPMG), relaxation effects, and NMR spectral acquisition times (3, 4, 5, and 6 s/scan) using PCA pattern recognition analysis. In addition, a quantitative validation is performed against various metabolites at physiological concentrations (9 microM-8 mM). "Targeted profiling" is highly stable in PCA-based pattern recognition, insensitive to water suppression, relaxation times (within the ranges examined), and scaling factors; hence, direct comparison of data acquired under varying conditions is made possible. In particular, analysis of metabolites at low concentration and overlapping regions are well suited to this analysis. We discuss how targeted profiling can be applied for mixture analysis and examine the effect of various acquisition parameters on the accuracy of quantification.},

This method is based on initial peak-finding among the spectra and uses jacknife classification performance as the basis for selection of peaks.

For illustrative purposes, this methodology is applied to a data set that contains 52 spectra from renal cell carcinoma and normal renal tissue samples.

abstract = {A constrained total-line-shape (CTLS) fitting strategy for organic impurity analysis from 1H NMR spectra was developed and assessed by studying two examples. In general, total-line-shape fitting allows integration of overlapping lines without suffering from baseline artifacts as much as traditional integration methods. It is shown here that the constrained total-line-shape fitting, where the spectral structures of the multiplets to be fitted are taken into account in form of constraints, allows quantification of seriously overlapping lines and when the signals are close to the root of major signals. Also, a method for removal of 13C satellite signals is described. The results indicate that our approach significantly improves the usefulness of qNMR in impurity analysis and that impurity levels of 0.1 mol\%, which in some cases means down to 0.01 wt\%, can be easily determined with relative standard error smaller than 10\%.},

A set of experimental in vivo 1H NMR spectra were first analyzed by the LF method to match the signal-to-noise ratios and linewidths of simulated spectra to those in the experimental data. The performance of constructed ANNs was compared for the peak area determinations of choline-containing compounds (Cho), total creatine (Cr), and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) signals using both manually phase-corrected and magnitude spectra as inputs. The peak area data from ANN and LF analyses for simulated spectra yielded high correlation coefficients demonstrating that the peak areas quantified with ANN gave similar results as LF analysis. Thus, a fully automated ANN method based on magnitude spectra has demonstrated potential for quantification of in vivo metabolites from long echo time spectroscopic imaging.},

abstract = {The interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experimental results for metabolomics studies requires intensive signal processing and multivariate data analysis techniques. Standard quantification techniques attempt to minimize effects from variations in peak positions caused by sample pH, ionic strength, and composition. These techniques fail to account for adjacent signals which can lead to drastic quantification errors. Attempts at full spectrum deconvolution have been limited in adoption and development due to the computational resources required. Herein, we develop a novel localized deconvolution algorithm for general purpose quantification of NMR-based metabolomics studies. Localized deconvolution decreases average absolute quantification error by 97\% and average relative quantification error by 88\%. When applied to a 1H metabolomics study, the cross-validation metric, Q2, improved 16\% by reducing within group variability. This increase in accuracy leads to additional computing costs that are overcome by translating the algorithm to the map-reduce design paradigm.},

@article{Martin1994,
abstract = {The performance of quantitative analysis of 1D NMR spectra depends greatly on the choice of the NMR signal model. Complex least-squares analysis is well suited for optimizing the quantitative determination of spectra containing a limited number of signals (<30) obtained under satisfactory conditions of signal-to-noise ratio (>20). From a general point of view it is concluded, on the basis of mathematical considerations and numerical simulations, that, in the absence of truncation of the free-induction decay, complex least-squares curve fitting either in the time or in the frequency domain and linear-prediction methods are in fact nearly equivalent and give identical results. However, in the situation considered, complex least-squares analysis in the frequency domain is more flexible since it enables the quality of convergence to be appraised at every resonance position. An efficient data-processing strategy has been developed which makes use of an approximate conjugate-gradient algorithm. All spectral parameters (frequency, damping factors, amplitudes, phases, initial delay associated with intensity, and phase parameters of a baseline correction) are simultaneously managed in an integrated approach which is fully automatable. The behavior of the error as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio is theoretically estimated, and the influence of apodization is discussed. The least-squares curve fitting is theoretically proved to be the most accurate approach for quantitative analysis of 1D NMR data acquired with reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. The method enables complex spectral residuals to be sorted out. These residuals, which can be cumulated thanks to the possibility of correcting for frequency shifts and phase errors, extract systematic components, such as isotopic satellite lines, and characterize the shape and the intensity of the spectral distortion with respect to the Lorentzian model. This distortion is shown to be nearly independent of the chemical species, of the nature of the molecular site, and of the type of nucleus, but to vary significantly with the spectrometer. The potential of the method for accurate fast and fully automatic quantitative analysis is illustrated in the case of natural-abundance deuterium NMR spectra such as those of linalool and ethyl mandelate.},

@article{Mercier2011,
abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Mass Spectroscopy (MS) are the two most common spectroscopic analytical techniques employed in metabolomics. The large spectral datasets generated by NMR and MS are often analyzed using data reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Although rapid, these methods are susceptible to solvent and matrix effects, high rates of false positives, lack of reproducibility and limited data transferability from one platform to the next. Given these limitations, a growing trend in both NMR and MS-based metabolomics is towards targeted profiling or "quantitative" metabolomics, wherein compounds are identified and quantified via spectral fitting prior to any statistical analysis. Despite the obvious advantages of this method, targeted profiling is hindered by the time required to perform manual or computer-assisted spectral fitting. In an effort to increase data analysis throughput for NMR-based metabolomics, we have developed an automatic method for identifying and quantifying metabolites in one-dimensional (1D) proton NMR spectra. This new algorithm is capable of using carefully constructed reference spectra and optimizing thousands of variables to reconstruct experimental NMR spectra of biofluids using rules and concepts derived from physical chemistry and NMR theory. The automated profiling program has been tested against spectra of synthetic mixtures as well as biological spectra of urine, serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Our results indicate that the algorithm can correctly identify compounds with high fidelity in each biofluid sample (except for urine). Furthermore, the metabolite concentrations exhibit a very high correlation with both simulated and manually-detected values.},

abstract = {Background: One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy is widely used for high-throughput characterization of metabolites in complex biological mixtures. However, the accurate identification of individual compounds is still a challenging task, particularly in spectral regions with higher peak densities. The need for automatic tools to facilitate and further improve the accuracy of such tasks, while using increasingly larger reference spectral libraries becomes a priority of current metabolomics research. Results: We introduce a web server application, called MetaboHunter, which can be used for automatic assignment of 1H-NMR spectra of metabolites. MetaboHunter provides methods for automatic metabolite identification based on spectra or peak lists with three different search methods and with possibility for peak drift in a user defined spectral range. The assignment is performed using as reference libraries manually curated data from two major publicly available databases of NMR metabolite standard measurements (HMDB and MMCD). Tests using a variety of synthetic and experimental spectra of single and multi metabolite mixtures show that MetaboHunter is able to identify, in average, more than 80\% of detectable metabolites from spectra of synthetic mixtures and more than 50\% from spectra corresponding to experimental mixtures. This work also suggests that better scoring functions improve by more than 30\% the performance of MetaboHunter’s metabolite identification methods. Conclusions: MetaboHunter is a freely accessible, easy to use and user friendly 1H-NMR-based web server application that provides efficient data input and pre-processing, flexible parameter settings, fast and automatic metabolite fingerprinting and results visualization via intuitive plotting and compound peak hit maps. Compared to other published and freely accessible metabolomics tools, MetaboHunter implements three efficient methods to search for metabolites in manually curated data from two reference libraries.},

abstract = {A new software tool has been developed that provides automated measurement of signal intensities in NMR spectra of complex mixtures without using data reduction procedures. The algorithm finds best-fit transformations between signals in reference compound spectra and the corresponding signals in analyte spectra. Unlike other algorithms, it is insensitive to variation in chemical shift and can even be used for relative quantitation of compounds whose identities have not yet been established. Additionally, the parameters of the transformation provide information and error metrics that may assist in the streamlining of quality control. The approach presented is general in scope but has been tested by application to peak quantitation in NMR spectra of biofluids. Replicate NMR measurements of solutions of biologically important compounds at various concentrations were made. Further NMR data were collected on urine samples from human, rat, and mouse, which were "spiked" with reference compound solutions at known concentrations. Finally, existing data from an independent toxicology project involving several hundred samples were analyzed, and the consistency of the measurements for metabolites that give multiple NMR signals was assessed. The results of all these tests give confidence that the technique can be used in automated quantitation of compounds in large NMR data sets with minimal operator intervention.},

abstract = {The absolute quantification of blood plasma metabolites by proton NMR spectroscopy is complicated by the presence of a baseline and broad resonances originating from serum macromolecules and lipoproteins. A method for spectral simplification of proton NMR spectra of blood plasma is presented. Serum macromolecules and metabolites are completely separated by utilizing the large difference in translational diffusion coefficients in combination with diffusion-sensitized proton NMR spectroscopy. The concentration of blood plasma metabolites can be quantified by using formate as an internal concentration reference. The results are compared with those obtained with ultrafiltration, a traditional method for separating macromolecules and metabolites, and demonstrate an excellent correlation between the two methods. The general nature of diffusion-sensitized NMR spectroscopy allows application on a wide range of biological fluids.},

The method is based on a separate removal of a residual water resonance followed by a frequency-selective time-domain line-shape fitting analysis of metabolite signals. Calculation of absolute metabolite concentrations was based on the internal water concentration as a reference. The estimated average metabolite concentrations acquired from six regions of normal human brain with a single-voxel spin-echo technique for the N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and choline-containing compounds were 11.4 +/- 1.0, 6.5 +/- 0.5, and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mumol kg-1 wet weight, respectively. The time-domain analyses of in vivo 1H MRS data from different brain regions with their specific characteristics demonstrate a case in which the use of frequency-domain methods pose serious difficulties.},

abstract = {A frequent problem in analysis is the need to find two matrices, closely related to the underlying measurement process, which when multiplied together reproduce the matrix of data points. Such problems arise throughout science, for example, in imaging where both the calibration of the sensor and the true scene may be unknown and in localized spectroscopy where multiple components may be present in varying amounts in any spectrum. Since both matrices are unknown, such a decomposition is a bilinear problem. We report here a solution to this problem for the case in which the decomposition results in matrices with elements drawn from positive additive distributions. We demonstrate the power of the methodology on chemical shift images (CSI). The new method, Bayesian spectral decomposition (BSD), reduces the CSI data to a small number of basis spectra together with their localized amplitudes. We apply this new algorithm to a 19F nonlocalized study of the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil in human liver, 31P CSI studies of a human head and calf muscle, and simulations which show its strengths and limitations. In all cases, the dataset, viewed as a matrix with rows containing the individual NMR spectra, results from the multiplication of a matrix of generally nonorthogonal basis spectra (the spectral matrix) by a matrix of the amplitudes of each basis spectrum in the the individual voxels (the amplitude matrix). The results show that BSD can simultaneously determine both the basis spectra and their distribution. In principle, BSD should solve this bilinear problem for any dataset which results from multiplication of matrices representing positive additive distributions if the data overdetermine the solutions.},

Through the application of pattern recognition and classification algorithms, the data have been shown to provide information on disease diagnosis and the beneficial and adverse effects of potential therapeutics. Here, a novel approach is described for identifying subsets of spectral patterns in databases of NMR spectra, and it is shown that the intensities of these spectral patterns can be related to the onset and recovery from a toxic lesion in both a time-related and dose-related fashion. These patterns form a new type of combination biomarker for the biological effect under study.

@article{Holmes1994,
abstract = {Multivariate data analysis techniques have been used to compare 600-MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of urine obtained from patients with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and urine obtained from healthy subjects. These spectra are very complex; each contains many thousands of resonances with a high dynamic range. A consistent method of reducing this wealth of data to manageable proportions is presented as a two-stage process. Computer-based spectral descriptors are automatically generated and then reduced to two-dimensional maps for visualization of clustering. Data-scaling methodology has been developed to achieve complete separation between spectra from control adults and those from adult patients with independently diagnosed IEM. The methods were refined by relating IEM samples to the mean of the control samples and applying supervised learning techniques to identify descriptors contributing to class separation. This approach allowed separation of the various classes of IEM and achieved optimal separation of patients with cystinuria from those with oxalic aciduria; the principal metabolites responsible for this separation were determined as lysine and glyoxalate. The methods developed were then extended by application to the more subtle problem of classifying urine collected from healthy subjects under different physiological conditions (i.e., pre- and post-exercise and in different stages of hydration) where, unlike the IEM case, any underlying biochemical differences were not known at the outset. Fluid-loaded and fluid-deprived samples could be partially separated as well as fluid-deprived and fluid-restored samples. Partial classification of samples on the basis of subject was also observed. Therefore, intersubject differences were liable to obscure the separation by physiological state. However, by relating each sample to a mean of the normal daily urine samples for the same person and applying a form of "range scaling" to exclude data which contributed least to class separation, improved classification of the hydration states resulted, from which it was possible to deduce those biochemical substances which were altered. These novel techniques for the data reduction and classification of NMR spectra make comprehensive use of all of the NMR spectral information and have clear potential to assist in clinical diagnosis.},

abstract = {In (1)H NMR metabolomic datasets, there are often over a thousand peaks per spectrum, many of which change position drastically between samples. Automatic alignment, annotation, and quantification of all the metabolites of interest in such datasets have not been feasible. In this work we propose a fully automated annotation and quantification procedure which requires annotation of metabolites only in a single spectrum. The reference database built from that single spectrum can be used for any number of (1)H NMR datasets with a similar matrix. The procedure is based on the generalized fuzzy Hough transform (GFHT) for alignment and on Principal-components analysis (PCA) for peak selection and quantification. We show that we can establish quantities of 21 metabolites in several (1)H NMR datasets and that the procedure is extendable to include any number of metabolites that can be identified in a single spectrum. The procedure speeds up the quantification of previously known metabolites and also returns a table containing the intensities and locations of all the peaks that were found and aligned but not assigned to a known metabolite. This enables both biopattern analysis of known metabolites and data mining for new potential biomarkers among the unknowns.},

The quantification strategies based on total-line-shape fitting are discussed. The metabolic model for CTLS includes 31 metabolites covering 85\% of the total spectral intensity, excluding the protein contribution. Prior to data analysis, the data was divided into patients with no Alzheimer's disease (AD), but with a normal AD marker profile (the peptide beta-amyloid(42) and tau protein) present in CSF, and into controls that do not have an AD marker profile in CSF. Unexpectedly large variations in metabolite concentrations within the two patient groups were detected, but an analysis of variance revealed a significant (P = 0.027) difference only in the concentration of creatinine which was higher in patients that had a normal AD marker profile. Multivariate classification tools such as self-organizing maps (SOM) failed in separation of the two classes.},

The quantitation problem is mathematically formulated as a separable nonlinear least-squares fitting problem, which is numerically solved using a modified variable-projection procedure. A macromolecular baseline is incorporated into the fit via nonparametric modelling, efficiently implemented using penalized splines. Unwanted components such as residual water are removed with a maximum-phase FIR filter. Constraints on the phases, dampings and frequencies of the metabolites can be imposed. AQSES has been tested on simulated MR spectra with several types of disturbance and on short echo time in vivo proton MR spectra. Results show that AQSES is robust, easy to use and very flexible.},

abstract = {This paper approaches the problem of intersample peak correspondence in the context of later applying statistical data analysis techniques to 1D 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. Any data analysis methodology will fail to produce meaningful results if the analyzed data table is not synchronized, i.e., each analyzed variable frequency (Hz) does not originate from the same chemical source throughout the entire dataset. This is typically the case when dealing with NMR data from biological samples. In this paper, we present a new state of the art for solving this problem using the generalized fuzzy Hough transform (GFHT). This paper describes significant improvements since the method was introduced for NMR datasets of plasma in Csenki et al. (Anal Bioanal Chem 389:875-885, 15) and is now capable of synchronizing peaks from more complex datasets such as urine as well as plasma data. We present a novel way of globally modeling peak shifts using principal component analysis, a new algorithm for calculating the transform and an effective peak detection algorithm. The algorithm is applied to two real metabonomic 1H-NMR datasets and the properties of the method are compared to bucketing. We implicitly prove that GFHT establishes the objectively true correspondence. Desirable features of the GFHT are: (1) intersample peak correspondence even if peaks change order on the frequency axis and (2) the method is symmetric with respect to the samples.},

abstract = {In this paper the possibility of obtaining accurate estimates of parameters of selected peaks in the presence of unknown or uninteresting spectral features in biomedical magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) signals is investigated. This problem is denoted by frequency-selective parameter estimation. A new time-domain technique based on maximum-phase finite impulse response (FIR) filters is presented. The proposed method is compared to a number of existing approaches: the application of a weighting function in the time domain, frequency domain fitting using a polynomial baseline, and the time-domain HSVD filter method. The ease of use and low computational complexity of the FIR filter method make it an attractive approach for frequency-selective parameter estimation. The methods are validated using simulations of relevant (13)C and (31)P MRS examples.},

Frequency-selective quantification refers to a method that analyzes spectral components in a selected frequency region, ignoring all the other components outside. The algorithm, referred to as MeFreS (Metropolis Frequency-Selective), is based on rank minimization of an opportune Hankel matrix. The minimization procedure is satisfied by the down-hill simplex method, implemented with the simulated annealing method. MeFreS does not use any preprocessing step or filter to suppress nuisance peaks, but the signal model function is directly fitted. In this manner, neither inherent signal distortions nor estimation biases to be corrected occur. The algorithm was tested with Monte Carlo simulations. A comparison with VARPRO and AMARESw algorithms was carried out. Finally, two samples of known content from NMR data were quantified.},

By using complete model spectra, rather than just individual resonances, maximum information and uniqueness are incorporated into the analysis. A constrained regularization method accounts for differences in phase, baseline, and lineshapes between the in vitro and in vivo spectra, and estimates the metabolite concentrations and their uncertainties. LCModel is fully automatic in that the only input is the time-domain in vivo data. The lack of subjective interaction should help the exchange and comparison of results. More than 3000 human brain STEAM spectra from patients and healthy volunteers have been analyzed with LCModel. N-acetylaspartate, cholines, creatines, myo-inositol, and glutamate can be reliably determined, and abnormal levels of these or elevated levels of lactate, alanine, scyllo-inositol, glutamine, or glucose clearly indicate numerous pathologies.

We review some of the distance functions proposed in the literature, among them the minimum distance link measure, the surjec- tion measure, and the fair surjection measure, and supply polynomial time algorithms for the computation of these measures. Furthermore, we introduce the minimum link measure, a new distance function which is more appealing than the other distance functions mentioned.We also present a polynomial time algorithm for computing this new measure. We further address the issue of defining a metric on point sets. We present the metric infimum method that constructs a metric from any distance functions on point sets. In particular, the metric infimum of the minimum link measure is a quite intuitive. The computation of this measure is shown to be in NP for a broad class of instances; it is NP-hard for a natural problem class.},

abstract = {Unambiguous identification of individual metabolites present in complex mixtures such as biofluids constitutes a crucial prerequisite for quantitative metabolomics, toward better understanding of biochemical processes in living systems. Increasing the dimensionality of a given NMR correlation experiment is the natural solution for resolving spectral overlap. However, in the context of metabolites, natural abundance acquisition of (1)H and (13)C NMR data virtually excludes the use of higher dimensional NMR experiments (3D, 4D, etc.) that would require unrealistically long acquisition times. Here, we introduce projection NMR techniques for studies of complex mixtures, and we show how discrete sets of projection spectra from higher dimensional NMR experiments are obtained in a reasonable time frame, in order to capture essential information necessary to resolve assignment ambiguities caused by signal overlap in conventional 2D NMR spectra. We determine optimal projection angles where given metabolite resonances will have the least overlap, to obtain distinct metabolite assignment in complex mixtures. The method is demonstrated for a model mixture composition made of ornithine, putrescine and arginine for which acquisition of a single 2D projection of a 3D (1)H-(13)C TOCSY-HSQC spectrum allows to disentangle the metabolite signals and to access to complete profiling of this model mixture in the targeted 2D projection plane.},

abstract = {A computational strategy for the deconvolution of complex spectra involving scalar multiplet patterns is presented. This approach fits spectra that can be composed of single resonances as well as scalar coupling multiplets for which resonance frequencies, intensities, and lineshape parameters can be optimized. For multiplets, the coupling constant also is optimized. Any external information about the optimizable parameters can be taken into account as external constraints. A lineshape described by absorptive and dispersive Lorentzian and Gaussian contributions and the baseline with up to 40 Fourier and polynomial terms can likewise be optimized. The effectiveness of the procedure is assessed on the basis of computer simulated deconvolutions of a composite of 1J(13C-2H) multiplets arising from a mixture of all possible 13C-2H isotopomers of deuterated L-[3-13C]lactate generated from cell preparations incubated with D-[1-13C]glucose in D2O, which was analyzed previously with a manual deconvolution procedure (R.

This considers a model of the time-domain complex free induction decay (FID) signal as a sum of exponentially damped sinusoidal components. The number of model components and component parameters are considered unknown random variables to be estimated. A Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is used to draw samples from the joint posterior distribution on the subspaces of different dimensions. The proposed algorithm has been tested on synthetic data, the (1)H NMR FID of a standard of L-glutamic acid and a blood plasma sample. The detection and estimation performance is compared with Akaike information criterion (AIC), minimum description length (MDL) and the matrix pencil method. The results show the Bayesian algorithm superior in performance especially in difficult cases of detecting low-amplitude and strongly overlapping resonances in noisy signals.},

When prior information is incorporated into the analysis of time domain data, the frequencies, decay rate constants, and amplitudes may be estimated much more precisely than by direct use of discrete Fourier transforms. Here, Bayesian probability theory is used to estimate paramters using quadrature models of NMR data. The calculation results in an interpretation of the quardature model fitting that allows one to understand on an intuitive level what frequencies and decay rates will be estimated and why.},

Following the least-squares fit, univariate statistics were used to identify metabolites associated with group differences. This method was evaluated through applications on simulated datasets and a murine diabetes dataset. Furthermore, we examined the differential ability of various weighting metrics to correctly identify discriminative markers. Our findings suggest that the weighted least-squares approach is effective for identifying biochemical discriminators of varying physiological states. Additionally, the superiority of specific weighting metrics is demonstrated in particular datasets. An additional strength of this methodology is the ability for individual investigators to couple this analysis with laboratory specific preprocessing techniques.},
