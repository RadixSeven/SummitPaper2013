This is the output for my experiment on how many principal components are actually not fitting noise in the shifted_1 dataset. I found the number of components from which the reconstruction of a noisy signal had the closest approximation to the original noiseless one. I used two reconstruction methods, one which rounded to match the domain of the original signal and one which did not.

Still open question - what happens when we don't just take the first n components but select features in general. Can we do better?

Either way, the number of components was significantly more than ANY of the methods for selecting the number of components from the scree plot gave.
